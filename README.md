# HouseHunters Website

This is a portal to simplify the house buying process for both buyers and sellers. 
 
Renters would be able to view available apartments along with information such as square footage, price, location, and neighborhood. They can search based on these criteria in order to find relevant listings.Buyers can contact the sellers for the properties which they like. They would also be able to favorite apartments.
Sellers would have the ability to post listings for available apartments including the above information. They can also get email notification about inquiries from interested buyers and respond with available viewing times.

## Instruction before using the webiste:

Your location services must be enabled in the browser for automatic apartment search in your nearby area. There is also an option to search by state/city/neighborhood. 

We have hosted the client and server application on heroku. So, give some time for the API to boot-up before searching or performing operations on the website. 

You must have cookies on the website for it to function properly. 

## Technologies used

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.3.
We have used MongoDB for the database and hosted the same on heroku.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
